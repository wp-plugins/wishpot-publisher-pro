This free plugin allows you to generate revenues from your blog by integrating products in your pages or sidebar.  You can create any pages by using the built-in short-codes or just use the widgets. 
The generated widgets differ in size (300x600, 300x250, 160x600, 120x600 etc.).   Products are automatically populated using the Wishpot products database.
